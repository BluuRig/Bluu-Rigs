BLUU RIG \ READ ME

This repository contains the rig base versions 1.7 & previous versions.

All rig bases within this repository are free to use in any way, as long as I am accredited with creating the BASE.

I will eventually make proper videos and/or write out tutorials for various demonstrations on how to setup/use these rigs. For now, I can't do much to assist.
